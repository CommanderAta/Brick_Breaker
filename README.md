# Brick Breaker Game - Java OOP Exploration

## Introduction

This Brick Breaker game is a fun and interactive way to explore the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. By playing and understanding how the game is structured, users can gain insights into the basics of Java OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

## Objective

The primary objective of the game is to break all the bricks on the screen by bouncing a ball off a paddle that the player controls at the bottom of the screen. The game ends when all bricks are broken or the player loses all their lives by missing the ball with the paddle.

## Features

- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Power-ups that enhance gameplay (e.g., extra lives, wider paddle)
- Score tracking and high-score table
- Simple yet engaging graphics and sound effects

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Launch the game application from your Java IDE or command line.
2. **Move the Paddle:** Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the paddle.
3. **Launch the Ball:** Press the spacebar to launch the ball towards the bricks.
4. **Clear the Bricks:** Aim the ball to hit and clear all the bricks on the screen.
5. **Advance Levels:** Upon clearing all bricks, the game progresses to the next level with a new brick layout.

## Development Environment

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** Any Java-supported IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
- **Libraries:** Standard Java libraries, Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) for GUI components

## Learning Outcomes

By engaging with this game, players/developers will:

- Understand the application of basic OOP principles in a real-world project
- Learn how to structure a program using classes and objects
- Explore event handling and GUI elements in Java
- Develop problem-solving and game design skills

## Contributions

Contributions to the game are welcome. Whether it's adding new features, improving the codebase, or reporting bugs, your input helps improve the learning experience for everyone.
